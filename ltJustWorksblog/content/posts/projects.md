Descriptions of the projects I'm currently working on.

## Gym Tracking App
- [x] Exercise search
- [x] Exercise progress charts
- [ ] Fix issue with last set data saving
- [ ] Improve app styling
- [ ] Redesign app logo and banner
- [ ] Improve app store listing
- [ ] Images in exercise descriptions

## EEG Sleep Tracker
- Conceptual
    - [ ] Get familiar with EEG readings, electrode setup, what signals to capture
- Hardware
    - [ ] Design circuit with EEG sensor and electrodes
    - [ ] Design housing (cap) for electrodes 
- Software
    - [ ] Data collection from EEG sensor
    - [ ] Processing data from EEG to get desired signals
    - [ ] Classification of sleep stages from EEG data (Use MNE library?)
    - [ ] Data visualization to view sleep stages
- Future ideas
    - Get data from good EEG sensors in a sleep lab,
    use as training data for classification model

## Other ideas
- Play around with Tang Nano FPGA
- Use BME280, MPU6050 with STM32
- Robotic arm with IMU
